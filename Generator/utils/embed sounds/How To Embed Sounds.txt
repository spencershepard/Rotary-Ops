1) Place your .miz file in this directory.
2) Run embed_sounds.exe
3) A new file will be created in the same directory; a copy of your mission file with RotorOps sound files already embedded so you don't need to add manually.  

Tip: You can use this tool to update your existing RotorOps missions with the current sound files.
