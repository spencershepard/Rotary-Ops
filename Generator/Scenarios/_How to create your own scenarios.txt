You can add your own scenarios in this directory and they will appear in the mission generator.

A scenario .miz file MUST have:

1) Between 1-4 trigger zones called "ALPHA", "BRAVO", "CHARLIE", "DELTA"
2) At least one trigger zone with a name that starts with "STAGING".
3) A blue airport near your staging zone.
4) A red airport near your last conflict zone.  

Optional: 
You can add smaller infantry spawning zones inside conflict zones.  Add near buildings to simulate infantry hiding within. Name them like "ALPHA_SPAWN", "ALPHA_SPAWN_2, etc.

Tips:
-The conflict game type can be played with blue forces on defense.  In this mode the last conflict zone is the only troop pickup zone.
-Design your template so that it can be played in normal 'attacking' mode or 'defending' the conflict zone from enemy ground units starting from the staging zone.
-Keep the zones fairly close together, both for helicopter and ground unit travel times. 
-You can place static objects and units in a scenario template.
-You can change mission briefing and other mission options in the template.
-Drop your templates in the RotorOps Discord if you'd like to have them added in a release for everyone.
