You can add your own unit templates in this directory and they will appear in the mission generator.

1) Create an empty mission on Caucasus 
2) Add ground unit groups.
3) Save the mission in this directory.

Tips:
-Drop your templates in the RotorOps Discord if you'd like to have them added in a release for everyone.
-The mission generator will only extract blue ground units from the template when selected from the "Blue Forces" menu, and vice versa.
